# End-to-End Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset to understand key factors that influenced passenger survival. The analysis focuses on data cleaning, visualization, and extracting meaningful insights using Python.

---

## 📊 Objectives
- Analyze passenger demographics and survival patterns  
- Identify key factors affecting survival (gender, class, age, fare, etc.)  
- Perform data cleaning and handling of missing values  
- Generate visual insights to support conclusions  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📁 Project Structure
- `21_Days_B5_D1.ipynb` – Main EDA notebook  
- `sample.html` – Auto-generated EDA report (optional)  
- `README.md` – Project documentation  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than males  
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive compared to lower classes  
- Age and fare showed noticeable impact on survival probability
